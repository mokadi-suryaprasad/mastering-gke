# ☸️ Mastering GKE — 20+ - Days Hands-On Learning Series

A complete **hands-on guide to mastering Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** — from Kubernetes fundamentals to advanced cluster operations.  
Each day covers one key concept with **practical labs**, **YAML manifests**, and **Google Cloud examples** to help you build real-world DevOps skills.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository helps you:

- 🧠 Understand **why orchestration is needed** beyond Docker.
- ⚙️ Learn **Kubernetes architecture** and how GKE simplifies cluster management.
- ☸️ Gain **hands-on experience** with Pods, Deployments, Services, and Storage.
- 🔐 Explore **advanced GKE concepts** such as Private Clusters, Cloud SQL integration, and Node Affinity.
- 🚀 Build confidence in managing **production-grade clusters** on Google Cloud.

A complete **hands-on learning journey** to master **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** — from Kubernetes fundamentals to advanced production operations.  
Each day covers a key concept with **labs**, **YAMLs**, and **real GCP implementations**.

---

## 🧭 Introduction

This repository is designed for **DevOps Engineers**, **Cloud Architects**, and **Kubernetes enthusiasts** who want to:
- Deploy and manage production workloads on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
- Automate infrastructure with **Terraform**
- Implement **GitOps** with **ArgoCD**
- Monitor, log, and secure clusters using **Prometheus, Grafana, EFK, Jaeger, and Cloud-native tools**

🎯 By the end of this series, you’ll be able to design, deploy, and operate **production-grade clusters on GCP** confidently.
